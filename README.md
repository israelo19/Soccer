# Soccer Game

This is a simple 2D soccer game implemented in Python using the Pygame library I made for my younger brother.

## Game Features

- Two players represented by squares, one blue and one red.
- A ball, also represented by a square.
- A green field with a white line in the center.
- Player movement controlled by keyboard inputs.
- Scoring system based on goals.

## How to Play

Players move around the field and try to hit the ball into the opponent's goal. The player with the most goals when the timer runs out wins the game.

## Controls

- Player 1: Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively.
- Player 2: Use the arrow keys to move.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.
